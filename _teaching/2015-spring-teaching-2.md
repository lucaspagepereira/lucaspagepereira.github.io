This workshop will focus more on a methodological and intuitive approach to the statistical procedures rather than on their formal and/or mathematical learning. It will include practical sessions using real data with the aid of software. The presentation of the methods will be coupled with presentations of recent research utilizing them.
The goal of this workshop is to enable any PhD candidates, postdocs, or researcher in Social Sciences to acquire and deepen data analysis methods and to choose an analysis strategy from a research perspective. Time slots are provided so that participants can discuss, if they wish and on an individual basis, the analysis of their own data with the workshop team.

GEOMETRIC DATA ANALYSIS WORKSHOP: Statistical Theory and Practical Application in Social Sciences
====

Geometric Data Analysis (GDA) encompasses methods widely used in various scientific disciplines, including sociology, with techniques such as Correspondence Analysis (CA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). Introduced into the social sciences by Pierre Bourdieu in the 1970s, GDA offers a powerful geometric approach to objectify complex social phenomena. However, advanced techniques like Class-specific Analysis (CSA) and combinatorial inference remain insufficiently disseminated and mastered by researchers.
