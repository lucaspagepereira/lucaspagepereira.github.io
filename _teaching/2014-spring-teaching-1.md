This course aims to provide solid foundations for social scientists who work with—or are planning to work with—textual datasets. Combining lectures and hands-on sessions, participants will be introduced to the theoretical and epistemological issues in textual data analysis and to a range of methods and tools essential for conducting their own analyses independently.

Overview
=====
In recent decades, the social sciences have undergone a transformation driven by the growing availability and importance of data in textual form. Whether such data come from archives (digitized or transcribed), from audio transcripts (interviews, parliamentary debates, speeches, etc.), from open-ended survey responses, or—above all—from the web, the multiplication of textual sources and the tools we now have to analyze them has moved discursive analysis to the foreground. From these materials it is possible to identify trends, behaviors, and social dynamics at scales and depths that were previously inaccessible (...)

Whereas a few decades ago textual corpora were handled largely through qualitative interpretation, the need to objectify structures and map similarities/differences across texts—and, above all, the ability to build ever larger corpora—quickly led to the use of statistical tools for textual analysis. Correspondence Analysis, for example, took shape in the early 1960s through Jean-Paul Benzécri’s work on textual and linguistic data, before being widely disseminated via Pierre Bourdieu’s research. Since then, new approaches have proliferated: semiometrics, lexicometry, topic modeling, semantic analysis, and generative models under the banner of so-called “artificial intelligence” are just a few examples of a broad repertoire progressively taken up by the social sciences—contributing to the emergence of fields such as digital humanities and computational social science.

This course aims to provide solid foundations for social scientists who work with—or are planning to work with—textual datasets. Combining lectures and hands-on sessions, participants will be introduced to the theoretical and epistemological issues in textual data analysis and to a range of methods and tools essential for conducting their own analyses independently.

Instructors
====

<b>Lucas Page Pereira</b> is a postdoctoral researcher at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, where he teaches textual data analysis in the master’s program in Quantitative Sociology and Demography. After a dissertation on Brazilian social stratification and the structure and evolution of social inequalities in early twenty-first-century Brazil (2021), his work has focused on cultural sociology and on developing new modes of research-based teaching at the university level.

<b>Julien Boelaert</b> is an associate professor of political science at the University of Lille. After a PhD in economics on the evolution of household budgets in France and Canada (2012), his research has centered on the history and sociology of parliaments (the European Parliament, the French National Assembly). In parallel, he examines the uses, limits, and effects of Big Data and machine learning in the social sciences.
