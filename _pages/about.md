  <b>Welcome!</b> I'm  sociologist interested in how numbers and data are produced and how they make up social worlds - from surveys to the Big Data; from philosophical concepts to economic indicators. Here you'll find my <b><a href = "https://lucaspagepereira.github.io/projects/">Research Projects</a></b> (current and past, with brief summaries and data/resources), <b><a href = "https://lucaspagepereira.github.io/publications/">Publications</a></b> (with supplementary materals), <b><a href = "https://lucaspagepereira.github.io/teaching/">Teaching</a></b> (sillabi, slides and tutorials) and a <b><a href = "https://lucaspagepereira.github.io/posts/">Research notebook</a></b> (i.e. a blog) where I share short fieldnotes, reading notes and other refections.
