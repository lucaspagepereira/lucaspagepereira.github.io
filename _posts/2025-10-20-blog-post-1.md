Combining textual data analysis and field theory, we show how the different chapters of a book can be read as discursive position-takings by their authors and, thus, how the book <i><a href = "https://www.up.pt/press/books/bourdieu-e-os-seus-livros"> Bourdieu e os livros </a> </i> presents itself as a "microcosm" of Pierre Bourdieu's reception in Portugal.


Where it all begins
======
This summer I was invited by <a href = "https://sigarra.up.pt/flup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=231939"> Virgílio Borges Pereira </a> to present a book of readings on Pierre Bourdieu’s work that he edited for the University of Porto Press, <a href = "https://www.up.pt/press/books/bourdieu-e-os-seus-livros"> <i>Bourdieu e os seus livros</a></i> (Bourdieu and His Books). But how do you present a book of which you are not an author to an audience composed, in part, of the very authors of its chapters?

In other words, I am an outsider to the Portuguese sociological field, vis-à-vis which — and for which — my contribution could only be quite modest. </p>
 Yet if this book offers a set of original readings of Bourdieu’s work by specialists in different areas, it can also be treated as a “microcosm” of the French sociologist’s reception in Portugal. To do so, one might treat each chapter as a discursive position-taken which reveal how these authors read Bourdieu’s oeuvre, how close or distant their approaches are, and what themes they emphasize. In short, it would be possible to reconstruct the work as a field.

Bourdieu, statistical analysis and field theory
======
Drawing upon the tradition of the French sociological school (or the "Durkheimian school"), and particularly the work of Maurice Halbwachs, Bourdieu mobilized statistics throughout his works sometimes as a form of sociological objectification; sometimes as a strategy to achieve an epistemological break with spontaneous and particularized knowledge of the social world. This was true whether using descriptive statistics to bring to light the association between individuals' social characteristics and their practices, perceptions, and position-takings, or using statistics as a strategy for the exploratory investigation of the relationships between the attributes of individuals and groups.

It is precisely from this second perspective that I wish to highlight three characteristics of Geometric Data Analysis (GDA). The first is that GDA, as its name suggests, places the geometric question at the center of the analysis—that is, the question of space and, consequently, of social space and the various fields that constitute it. This implies:

<ul>
    <li>A change in the vocabulary and the questions we can pose to the data—requiring fewer methodological assumptions (e.g., the absence of co-linearity among covariates, as required in regression).</li>
    <li>Thinking in terms of distance, regions, and sub-regions... but also of movement, reinforcing, through the rarity of a characteristic </li>
    <li>Classes: Thinking of classes not only as the result of a position within a theoretically relevant social structure, but as the result of the similarity of the relevant characteristics that define them.</li>
    <li>Sociology of variables vs. sociology of individuals. Unlike the dominant paradigm, which is interested almost exclusively in the "effect of variables," Geometric Data Analysis allows us to focus on individuals and their relationships within a given space.</li>
</ul>
It is a relational method insofar as, mathematically, it is based on the structure of the distribution of a set of characteristics that individuals are distributed throughout a multidimensional space — a space which can then be explored incrementally through the very elements that structure the distribution of those characteristics. In a sense, this strategy translates into a visual representation of the relational form among individuals.

A book as the microcosm of a reception
======
To analyze the way in which the different chapters of <i>Bourdieu e os seus livros</i> relate to one another (and to the work of Pierre Bourdieu), I performed a quantitative analysis of the chapters' content (see diagram below). This approach is not only not new, but it was precisely in the analysis of textual materials that Jean-Paul Benzécri improved Correspondence Analysis in the 1950s-1960s. The difference here is that I did not start from manual coding and pre-processing, but rather from the use of LLMs, which make the task less arduous.

The semantic space
-----
First, let us look at the discursive forms, present in the projection of the semantic space (image 1).

The author's space
----
Next, let us turn our attention to the authors who are linked to each of these regions of the space.
