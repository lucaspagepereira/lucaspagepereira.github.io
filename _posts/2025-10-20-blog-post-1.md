Combining textual data analysis and field theory, we show how the different chapters of a book can be read as discursive position-takings by their authors and, thus, how the book <i><a href = "https://www.up.pt/press/books/bourdieu-e-os-seus-livros"> Bourdieu e os livros </a> </i> is a sort of "microcosm" of Pierre Bourdieu's reception in Portugal.


Where it all begins
======
This summer I was invited by <a href = "https://sigarra.up.pt/flup/en/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=231939"> Virgílio Borges Pereira </a> to present a book of readings on Pierre Bourdieu’s work that he edited for the University of Porto Press, <a href = "https://www.up.pt/press/books/bourdieu-e-os-seus-livros"> <i> Bourdieu e os seus livros</a> </i>. But how do you present a book of which you are not an author to an audience composed, in part, of the very authors of its chapters?

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><img width=349 height=262
src="/images/posts/2025/Porto_2025.jpeg" align=right hspace=12>The task was all the more delicate because, although I am a sociologist and my work is in dialogue with Bourdieu's approaches of sociological objects, I am Brazilian, I work in France, and I study objects situated in a space that does not coincide with the Portuguese social space. In other words, I am an outsider to the Portuguese sociological field, vis-à-vis which — and for which — my contribution could only be quite modest.</p>

However, in reading the book — and becoming aware of the effect that, as José Madureira Pinto puts it in his chapter, the “epistemological fragmentation bomb” of Bourdieu’s work had on that group of sociologists — I realized something was missing. Strictly speaking, it is not exactly an absence — or at least not the absence of a particular book, concept, or interlocutor worth discussing. Rather, it is a series of passing allusions throughout the volume that, like the “return of the repressed” in psychoanalysis, bring to the surface structural elements that are hard to weave into a coherent narrative because they are <i>partout et en nulle part</i>. In this case, I meant Pierre Bourdieu’s use of statistics in his sociological approch and, in particular <b>Geometric Data Analysis (GDA)</b>.

To highlight this absence — and, at the same time, to show how statistics can be used as a tool for objectifying a field of relations — I adopted the following strategy: although this <b>book</b> offers a set of original readings of Bourdieu’s work by specialists in different areas, it can also be <b>treated as a “microcosm” of the French sociologist’s reception in Portugal</b>. To do so, I treated each chapter as a discoursive position-taking, revealing how these authors read Bourdieu’s works, how close or distant their approaches are from one another, and which themes, concepts, and methods they emphasize. <b>In short, it is possible to reconstruct the book as a field</b>.

Bourdieu, statistical analysis and field theory
======
The aim here is not to revisit the role of statistics in Pierre Bourdieu’s work—a topic thoroughly examined by other scholars (see, e.g., Blasius et al., 2019; Duval et al., 2023; Lebaron & Le Roux, 2015) — but to foreground a few elements that will be useful for what follows. Drawing upon the tradition of the French sociological school (or the "Durkheimian school"), and particularly the work of Maurice Halbwachs, Bourdieu mobilized statistics throughout his works sometimes as a form of sociological objectification; sometimes as a strategy to achieve an epistemological break with spontaneous and particularized knowledge of the social world. This was true whether using descriptive statistics to bring to light the association between individuals' social characteristics and their practices, perceptions, and position-takings, or using statistics as a strategy for the exploratory investigation of the relationships between the attributes of individuals and groups.

It is precisely from this second perspective that I wish to highlight three characteristics of GDA. The first is that GDA, as its name suggests, places the geometric question at the center of the analysis—that is, the question of space and, consequently, of social space and the various fields that constitute it. This implies:

<ul>
    <li>A change in the vocabulary and the questions we can ask to the data—requiring fewer methodological assumptions (e.g., the absence of co-linearity among covariates, homoscedasticity, independently and identically distributed errors etc.).</li>
    <li>Thinking in terms of distance, regions, and sub-regions... but also of movement, shapes, perspectives etc. </li>
    <li>Representation of classes not only as the result of a position within a theoretically relevant category, but as the result of the similarity of the relevant observed characteristics that define them. </li>
    <li> Bringing individuals back into the analysis: unlike the dominant paradigm, which is interested almost exclusively in the "effect of variables," GDA allows us to focus on individuals and their relationships within a given space.</li>
</ul>
It is a relational method insofar as, mathematically, it is based on the structure of the distribution of a set of characteristics that individuals are distributed throughout a multidimensional space — a space which can then be explored incrementally through the very elements that structure the distribution of those characteristics. In a sense, this strategy translates into a visual representation of the relational form among individuals and variables.

A book as the microcosm of a reception
======
To analyze how the chapters of Bourdieu e os seus livros relate to one another — and to Bourdieu’s oeuvre — I conducted a quantitative content analysis (see the diagram below). This approach is not new: Jean-Paul Benzécri’s work on textual materials was pivotal in advancing Correspondence Analysis in the 1960s–1970s (see Benzécri, 1981). The methodological difference here is that, rather than relying on manual coding and pre-processing, I used large language models (LLMs) to assist feature extraction and coding, making the workflow less labor-intensive, faster, and easier to replicate.

Treating each chapter as a "discursive position-taking" is sociologically fruitful because it shifts attention from isolated arguments to the patterned relations among authors, concepts, and stylistic choices that constitute a subfield. Correspondence Analysis is especially well suited to bring this to the fore: by mapping vocabulary differences and the co-occurrence structure of terms, it captures not only what is written (themes, references, problematics) but also how it is written (lexical style, rhetorical framing, preferred conceptual pairings). The resulting factor space makes visible proximities and oppositions—clusters of shared language, isolated stylistic outliers, and gradients linking neighboring positions—thus offering, even in an exploratory mode, a cartography of the subfield of Bourdieu’s reception in Portugal. In short, the method renders discursive style analytically legible as a social fact, positioning texts and authors within a common relational space.

The semantic space
-----
First, let us look at the discursive forms, present in the projection of the semantic space (cf. Figure below).Along the horizontal axis (which explains the most variance in the cloud), we observe an opposition between, on the left side, terms such as “spectacle,” “sign,” “dance,” “corporeality,” “hexis,” “performativity,” “scenic,” “accent,” and “linguistic.” These terms broadly refer to forms of <b>artistic expression</b>, the place of embodiment of the social, and the role of languages (musical, dance, everyday speech etc.) in the social world.
The right side, in turn, is marked by terms such as “science,” “routine,” “habitus,” “behavioral,” “rationality,” “action,” “generally,” “utility,” “neoclassical,” “consumer,” and “inhabit.” These are terms that refer both to aspects of <b>scientific approach</b> and to analyses centered on rationality conditioned by habitus operating in a field (as in Bourdieu's studies on the housing market).

<br>
The vertical axis, in turn, contrasts terms such as “neoclassical,” “behavioral,” “company,” “economy,” “uncertainty,” “utility,” “consumer,” and “preference” at the bottom. In other words, these analyses focus on <b>economic phenomena</b> or economic science treated as a sociological process.
At the top, we find terms such as “symbolization,” “ethnology,” “Kabyle,” “ethnological,” “genealogical,” “atelier,” “painter,” and “master.” These texts specifically refer to qualitative approaches to phenomena, particularly <b>ethnography</b> (and Kabyle ethnography in Bourdieu's work).

<br>

The author in the space
----
Next, let us turn our attention to the authors who are linked to each of these regions of the space (Figure 2, below). As indicated, the units of analysis here are the chapters, and thus the authors are those who wrote the different contributions that make up the book. This is why, for example, Virgílio Borges Pereira appears twice in the graph—but here, demonstrating the power of statistical analysis and the coherence of his writing, both chapters are found in very close positions in the semantic space (on the right, at the top). This shows that even when dealing with different themes, Virgílio Borges Pereira's style and reappropriation of Bourdieu's work tend to express themselves in very similar discursive forms.

If Virgílio Borges Pereira represents one of the poles of this semantic space (i.e., the one linked to ethnography), he is vertically opposed to Ester Gomes da Silva (who is an economist), and both, situated on the horizontal pole of science, are opposed to Cláudia Marisa Oliveira (who is a dramaturg).

An interesting feature is the central position occupied by José Madureira Pinto in the map. This reflects his pivotal role in disseminating Bourdieu’s work in Portugal and in cultivating the Porto-based cohort of sociologists who engage critically with it. This centrality can be read as an index of his influence on the other authors, who—consciously or not—adopt overlapping vocabularies and stylistic habits.

Furthermore, if we look at the two supplementary variables we have, we can see that foreign authors position themselves more on the “science” side—that is, they adopt a more general register, foregrounding “big questions,” and are therefore less anchored in Portuguese social realities, giving far less space to an affective relationship with Bourdieu’s work (as we find in the chapters by Portuguese authors). We also observe a marked gender difference: men are distributed vertically along the “science” pole, whereas women are distributed more horizontally.

Conclusion — An invitation to read
====
<b>So, what now—Is this book worth reading?</b> <i><a href = "https://www.up.pt/press/books/bourdieu-e-os-seus-livros">Bourdieu e os seus livros</a> </i> is more than a tribute: it is a material landmark in the collective memory of a community of readers. Like the milestones that orient travelers, it fixes in time the moment of a colloquium and gives tangible form to one possible map of Bourdieu’s oeuvre in Portugal. Yet it is not a reliquary that seals the sacred; it is a living cartography, showing how concepts, tools, and intuitions travel and interlace with Portuguese social life. Along the way, it offers an affective portrait of access — how a generation first encountered Bourdieu across linguistic barriers and uneven publishing timelines — and registers the “epistemological fragmentation bomb” that his work detonated in local habits of thought.

Because each chapter is a situated position-taking, the book also sheds light on the state, dynamics, and autonomy of the Portuguese sociological field: who introduces which texts, how symbolic capital circulates between authors and books, and how Bourdieu’s ideas are taught, appropriated, and argued with. Its originality lies precisely here. This is not another panoramic primer, nor a philosopher’s “reader.” It is a usable map of a living field—one that helps readers locate themselves according to their intellectual interests, and invites them to keep the conversation moving.

To conclude, this book offers a distinctive, living reading of Pierre Bourdieu’s work. More than homage or abstract speculation, it is a sociological undertaking. It presents sociology as a specific mode of inquiry and discourse—one that mobilizes concepts, methods, and argumentative forms to translate, grasp, and, ideally, understand the forms of life we confront every day. In doing so, it helps institute a “discursive real” in which what is most intimate in experience becomes legible in, through, and beyond the latticework of the social.
